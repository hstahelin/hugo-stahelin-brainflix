# BrainFlix Prototype Project

## Project Description

This project is part of the BrainStation Software Engineering Bootcamp and aims to teach HTML, CSS, Sass, JavaScript, and React through the development of a video streaming platform prototype called BrainFlix. The project is divided into three deliverables, each focusing on specific tasks to be completed within a set timeframe.

## Project Overview

### Deliverable 1

In the first deliverable, the task is to build a prototype for the BrainFlix video streaming platform. Provided with mockups and design specifications from BrainFlix's Creative Director, the task is to create static function components to construct a functioning and responsive app prototype.

### Deliverable 2

For the second deliverable, updated mockups for an additional screen and new features are provided. The goal is to implement these features using JavaScript to make the site interactive. Additionally, add a second page to the site according to the provided mockups and design specs.

### Deliverable 3

In the final sprint, the decision has been made to build an actual API for the prototype. The task is to develop this API service based on the mock API used previously. This involves creating a new repository for the server-side code and updating the client application to utilize your API service for managing video data.

## Project Structure

The project follows a structured approach with three sprints, each focusing on specific tasks:

1. **Sprint 1**: Develop static function components for the BrainFlix prototype based on provided mockups and design specifications.
2. **Sprint 2**: Implement new features and interactivity using JavaScript. Add a second page to the site according to updated mockups and design specs.
3. **Sprint 3**: Build an actual API service to manage video data for the prototype. Develop server-side code and update the client application to use the new API service.
